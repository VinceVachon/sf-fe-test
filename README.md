Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --open
```
